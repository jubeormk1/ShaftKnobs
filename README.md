# ShaftKnobs
A parametric model to accomodate Pot and switches shaft with a simple knob, captured with a cheap caliper and modelled with [openSCAD](https://openscad.org/).

## Use

Use OpenSCAD to view and customise the code. You can modify most of the parameters to a point where they will not make sense. Edit the file, add text to the surface, make it viable for 24 spline or 18 spline pots, add a hole to add a bolt and a nut... I wonder if you can do inheritance with OpenSCAD. I hadn't tested yet and some more customisation will follow to make it stronger and suited for the knob in the slow cooker that I am willing to fix.

## Motivation

Slow cooker electric pots make delicious meals, even the cheap ones. But cheap ones quite often are cheap because they save in details... like knobs for rotatory switches! This is why we ended up using pliers to operate the device... That soon will not be necesary since now I have (and share) a fully customisable knob that can be adjusted in too many parameters!

## If you are looking for a good model

There are way better knobs out there ready to be customised... like this one made by ["charliearmorycom"](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:54024).
